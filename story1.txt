Alex wanted to BECOME a FULL-STACK developer. However, their journey started with many hurdles!!! ðŸ’»ðŸ’¡

They spent HOURS reading docs.... <div>debugging</div> code & making mistakes. Sometimes they typed code like: 
print("Hello world!!!") --- but it didnâ€™t work (because they forgot a closing parenthesis).
